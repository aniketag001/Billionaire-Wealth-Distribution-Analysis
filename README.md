# Billionaire-Wealth-Distribution-Analysis
In this project we have analyze the Billionaires Statistics dataset to uncover insights related to wealth distribution, industries, and the various socio-economic factors affecting billionaires across the globe.  we have created actionable insights that can help understand patterns in global wealth. The workflow involves data cleaning using Python, storing structured data in an SQL database, and creating an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualization.

🛠 Project Phases
🔍 1. Planning Phase
✔ Defined project objectives and approach.
✔ Acquired and assessed the Billionaires dataset.
✔ Outlined the workflow for data processing, SQL integration, and dashboard creation.

🐍 2. Python Phase (EDA & Data Cleaning)
✔ Loaded the dataset using pandas.
✔ Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify missing values and outliers.
✔ Cleaned the data by handling missing values and standardizing formats.
✔ Created new derived columns for better analysis.
✔ Saved the cleaned dataset for SQL integration.

🗄 3. SQL Phase (Database Integration)
✔ Designed a relational database schema to store the cleaned dataset.
✔ Used SQLAlchemy/pandas to load data into SQL tables.
✔ Optimized queries for efficient data retrieval.

📊 4. Power BI Phase (Dashboard & Analysis)
✔ Connected Power BI to the SQL database.
✔ Built an interactive dashboard to visualize dentifying trends and patterns in industries and wealth sources.
✔ Implemented filters and visualizations to analyze different aspects of the dataset.

🏗 Technologies Used
🔹 Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, SQLAlchemy)
🔹 SQL (database setup and queries)
🔹 Power BI (dashboard creation and visualization)

2️⃣ Install dependencies:

pip install pandas sqlalchemy matplotlib seaborn
3️⃣ Run the Python script for data cleaning.
4️⃣ connect the cleaned dataset to an SQL database via python.
5️⃣ Connect Power BI to SQL and open the dashboard file.


🏆 Conclusion
This project provides a data-driven approach to understanding billionaires networth accross globe. The integration of Python, SQL, and Power BI allows for efficient data processing and insightful visualizations. Future enhancements may include real-time data updates or predictive modeling.
